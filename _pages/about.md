I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. My advisors are [Stilian Stoev](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sstoev/) and [Yang Chen](https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io//). My research interests are extreme value theory and its applications, particularly to problems in astronomy. I am also interested in the applications of statistics in astronomy more broadly.
